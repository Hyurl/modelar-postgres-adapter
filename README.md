# Modelar-Postgres-Adapter

**This is an adapter for [Modelar](https://github.com/hyurl/modelar) to** 
**connect PostgreSQL database.**

Before Modelar 3.0.4, this module is internally included by Modelar, you don't
have to download it before using it.

BUT since version 3.0.4, you must included manually.

## Prerequisites

- `NodeJS` version higher than 4.5.0.

## How To Use

```javascript
const { DB } = require("modelar");
const { PostgresAdapter } = require("modelar-postgres-adapter");

DB.setAdapter("postgres", PostgresAdapter);
DB.init({
    type: "postgres",
    database: "modelar",
    host: "127.0.0.1",
    port: 5432,
    user: "postgres",
    password: "******"
});
```

## Warning

If you want to use full features of Modelar with this adapter, you must set an 
`id` field for every table as its primary key.
